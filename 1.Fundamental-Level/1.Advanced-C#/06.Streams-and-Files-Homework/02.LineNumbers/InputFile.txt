Water on Mars exists today almost entirely
as ice, though it also exists in small 
quantities as vapour in the atmosphere
and occasionally as low-volume liquid 
brines in shallow Martian soils. 
The only place where water ice is visible
at the surface is at the north polar ice cap. 
Abundant water ice is also present beneath 
the permanent carbon dioxide ice cap at 
the Martian south pole and in the shallow 
subsurface at more temperate latitudes.
More than five million cubic kilometers 
of ice have been identified at or near the 
surface of modern Mars, enough to cover the 
whole planet to a depth of 35 meters.
Even more ice is likely to be locked away 
in the deep subsurface.
